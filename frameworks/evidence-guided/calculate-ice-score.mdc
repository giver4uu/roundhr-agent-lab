# 규칙: ICE 기반 아이디어 우선순위화 (Evidence-Guided)

## 목표
아이디어 설명과 현재 상태를 입력받아 **Impact, Confidence, Ease**로 점수를 매기고, **ICE Score = Impact × Confidence × Ease**를 계산하여 실행 우선순위를 제안합니다. 모든 평가는 명시적 기준을 따라야 하며 명시된 증거에만 의존해야 합니다—추론이나 추측 금지.

---

## 사용 시점
- 아이디어 백로그를 빠르게 정렬하고 탐색 및 실험 항목을 선택하기 위해
- 최소한 일부 명시적 증거(인터뷰/데이터/테스트)와 대략적인 팀 노력 추정치가 있을 때
- Opportunity-Solution Tree의 리프 기회에 대한 실험 계획을 작성하기 전

---

## 입력
- **아이디어 제목 및 설명**: 목표, 타겟 메트릭, 범위, 작업 가설
- **아이디어 분석 및 현재 상태**: 데이터/사용자/시장/테스트 증거, 실행 가설, 리스크, 노력 추정치
- 선택사항:
  - 타겟 메트릭 및 예상 변화율 (%) 또는 범위
  - 추정 노력 (person-weeks)

## 점수 모델

### 1) Impact 매핑
| Target Metric Change (%) | Impact |
|--------------------------|--------|
| > 50%                    | 10     |
| 35 - 49.9%               | 9      |
| 25 - 34.9%               | 8      |
| 18 - 24.9%               | 7      |
| 12 - 17.9%               | 6      |
| 7 - 11.9%                | 5      |
| 4 - 6.9%                 | 4      |
| 2 - 3.9%                 | 3      |
| 0.5 - 1.9%               | 2      |
| 0.1 - 0.4%               | 1      |
| ≤ 0%                     | 0      |

- Automatic fallback: If no explicit percentage is provided, assume a default +1.5% improvement → Impact 2.

### 2) Ease 매핑 (추정 노력: person-weeks)
| Duration | Ease |
|---------|------|
| < 1 week | 10 |
| 1–2 weeks | 9 |
| 3–4 weeks | 8 |
| 5–6 weeks | 7 |
| 6–7 weeks | 6 |
| 8–9 weeks | 5 |
| 10–12 weeks | 4 |
| 13–16 weeks | 3 |
| 17–25 weeks | 2 |
| ≥ 26 weeks | 1 |

### 3) 증거 유형 (Impact에 직접 연결된 증거만 계산)
| Evidence Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Test Results | A/B tests, longitudinal user studies, beta experiments, large MVPs with quantitative validation |
| User-based Evidence | Product usage data, 20+ user interviews, usability studies, MVP results/feedback |
| Market Data | Surveys, smoke tests, “table stakes” in the competitive set |
| Empirical Evidence | Few data points, sales requests, 1–3 interested customers, one competitor has the feature |
| Estimates & Plans | Internal model-based estimates, feasibility review with Eng/Design, schedule/business model analysis |
| Opinions of Others | Executives/colleagues/experts/investors opinions |
| Directional Fit | Alignment with company vision/strategy, tech/market trends, external research, macro trends |
| Self-belief | Personal intuition/gut feel/experience |

- Caution: Use only explicitly stated evidence in the input. No inference.
- Statements like “intuitively”, “personally I think”, “my gut says” → classify as Self-belief.
- Without explicit quantitative backing, do not accept as Market Data or Estimates & Plans.

### 4) Confidence 계산
- Principle: Include only evidence that directly supports Impact.
- Per-type contribution = MIN(Weight × count, Max)
- Group caps (sum upper bounds):
  - Self-belief + Directional Fit ≤ 0.1
  - Opinions of Others + Estimates & Plans ≤ 0.5
  - Market Data + User-based Evidence ≤ 3.0

| Evidence Type | Weight | Max |
|---|---:|---:|
| Self-belief | 0.01 | 0.1 |
| Directional Fit | 0.05 | 0.1 |
| Opinions of Others | 0.10 | 0.5 |
| Estimates & Plans | 0.30 | 0.5 |
| Empirical Evidence | 0.50 | 1.0 |
| Market Data | 1.0 | 3.0 |
| User-based Evidence | 2.0 | 3.0 |
| Test Results | 3.0 | 5.0 |

- Keyword hints (examples): “test/experiment/AB”, “user request/behavioral data”, “market/competitor/table stakes”, “estimate/modeling”, “intuition/gut/personally”.

### 5) ICE Score 및 우선순위 해석
- Formula: ICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease
- Interpretation:
  - ≥ 250: Consider immediate execution (high expected ROI)
  - 150–249: Promising; recommend additional precision testing
  - 100–149: Proceed with mitigations or phase-two testing
  - < 100: On hold or needs strengthening

---

## 프로세스

1) Input validation
- Verify target metric, expected change (%), evidence text, and estimated effort (person-weeks)
- If missing, ask clarifying questions about metric/change, effort, and evidence type/source

2) Impact scoring
- Map % change to table; if missing, apply default Impact 2

3) Ease scoring
- Map person-weeks to table; if uncertain, use conservative lower ease

4) Evidence extraction and classification
- Count only Impact-related evidence from the input
- Tally per type and apply group caps

5) Confidence calculation
- Sum per-type contributions → apply group caps → final Confidence (0–10)

6) ICE computation and bucket
- Compute ICE = I × C × E; assign interpretation bucket

7) Report generation
- Include score table, calculation rationale, cap applications, risks/assumptions, and recommended next steps

## 예시
- Idea: “AI-based revenue anomaly detection dashboard”
- Expected change: 26% → Impact 8  
- Effort: 5 weeks → Ease 7  
- Confidence input:
  - User-based Evidence (3) → 2.0 × 3 = 6.0 → Group C cap (≤ 3.0) → 3.0
  - Estimates & Plans (2) → 0.3 × 2 = 0.6 → Group B cap (≤ 0.5) → 0.5
  - Total: 3.0 + 0.5 = 3.5 → Final C = 3.5  
- ICE = 8 × 3.5 × 7 = 196 → “Promising; recommend additional precision testing”

---

## Customization (Team Tuning)
- Adjust Impact bands to your target metric sensitivity
- Adjust Ease bands to team speed/role mix
- Extend evidence keywords to your domain language, while preserving the “explicit evidence only” rule
- Recalibrate bucket thresholds per quarterly capacity/roadmap density

---

## Guardrails
- Do not invent/infer evidence or over-credit weak signals
- Exclude evidence not directly tied to Impact from Confidence
- When uncertain, apply conservative caps and document in “Risks/Assumptions”
- Prevent duplicate counting of the same source/content

---

## Error Handling
- Missing % change/effort: apply default rules (Impact 2) or ask clarifying questions
- Insufficient evidence: request the needed evidence types with examples
- Conflicting info: note conflicts and dependent assumptions; use conservative scoring

---

## Interaction Model
1) Collect & validate inputs → 2) Score I/E → 3) Classify/count evidence → 4) Compute Confidence (with caps) → 5) Compute ICE & assign bucket → 6) Generate report → 7) Resolve gaps/uncertainties and update
